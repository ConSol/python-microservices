# 2nd Microservice

Create a second microscervice which will then recieve the message from the dispo exchange.

It is completely independent from our first microservice and have an even more simple domain model. It would reside in a separate git repository, but for training purposes it does not.


- create cleaning service
- api for list days with service
- deployment descriptor
